# Use

First you must have a free or paid api-key from BreachDirectory.org, if you don't have one and do a search D4TA-HUNTER provides you with a guide on how to get one.

Once you have the api-key you will be able to search for emails, with the advantage of showing you a list of all the password hashes ready for you to copy and paste into one of the online resources provided by D4TA-HUNTER to crack passwords 100 % free.

You can also insert a domain of a company and D4TA-HUNTER will search for employee emails, subdomains that may be of interest together with IP's of machines found:
